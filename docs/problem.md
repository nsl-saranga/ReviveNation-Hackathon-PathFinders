# Problem Statement: Government Building Tracker

## Context & Pain Point

In Sri Lanka, the government owns and manages thousands of public buildings—ranging from schools and hospitals to administrative offices and community centers. However, a significant portion of these assets are either poorly tracked or inconsistently maintained. No centralized system exists to monitor whether a building is actively in use, under renovation, or abandoned. This challenge is especially evident at the divisional and provincial levels, where buildings formerly used as rural hospitals, educational offices, cooperative societies, or local administrative centers often fall into disuse due to institutional restructuring or shifting priorities. Despite being funded by public budgets, many are left unused, repurposed informally, or simply forgotten.

Key challenges include:

•	Many buildings are abandoned or underutilized without notice.
•	Some are in urgent need of renovation but go unnoticed.
•	Funds are misallocated to new construction while existing assets decay.
•	Maintenance history is undocumented, leading to inefficiency and waste.
•	Decision-makers lack real-time visibility over the condition and usage of government infrastructure


This lack of visibility leads to inefficient resource allocation, overlapping budgets for new constructions while old buildings lie unused, and delays in maintaining critical public infrastructure.

## Evidence

* A 2021 audit by the National Audit Office of Sri Lanka reported that over 350 buildings in the North Central and Eastern Provinces were found to be either abandoned or in poor condition despite appearing in active status in local government inventories.
* Media investigations have revealed public properties—including disused agrarian service centers and rural cooperative society buildings—being informally occupied or left as garbage dumping grounds.
* A 2022 local government review in the Central Province highlighted cases where multiple budget allocations were made to renovate buildings that had already been abandoned.

Quotes:

* "There is no system to know which buildings are in use unless the Grama Niladhari or someone from the area informs us." — Assistant Divisional Secretary, Kurunegala

* "Many of our old cooperative buildings are being used as stores or left empty, but we still get requests to build new ones." — District Planning Officer, Anuradhapura

## Scope

This problem affects public infrastructure management across provincial, district, and divisional secretariats. Our system focuses on:

* Divisional or zonal-level tracking of building status (active, abandoned, under renovation).
* Administrative dashboards for local authorities (Divisional Secretariats, Pradeshiya Sabhas) and oversight by central ministries (e.g., Ministry of Public Administration, Urban Development Authority).
* Structured updates on last renovation date, current use type (school, hospital, administrative office, etc.), and access control for roles.

It does not cover:

* Private or semi-government buildings.
* Real-time sensor-based condition monitoring (out of scope for MVP).
* Direct citizen access in MVP (future enhancement).

The solution is scoped for MVP implementation in 1–3 zones within Sri Lanka—such as selected DS divisions in the Western Province—with mock DPI integration.
